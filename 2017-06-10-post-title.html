        <p> I have really started to dive into coding and have found many resources. Currently I'm using <a href="https://freecodecamp.com">Free Code Camp</a>. They have an extensive curriculum, youtube videos and a gitterchat to speak with other coders. I'll eventually make a link page that has a list of all the resources that have helped me tremendously. It's also important to find a community of individuals that code as well. They can help answer questions you may have or someone else may have a question you may have recently found out. Join <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a>, slack, find local meetups, and more. With anything you want to be successful in you take it head on and work on it daily, even if just 30 minutes a day. I have been ask to do a remote talk at the end of July about how I've had to learn. Not everyone has access to everything and I have time during the week on the drive to various construction jobs so I'm limited to my phone. I started with the SoloLearn app from the Google Play Store. There are HTML, CSS, Javascript and other courses that you can complete and receive a certificate once you complete them. There are also challenges and you can follow fellow coders and test your code in the app. I also used the Free Code Camp site and completed challenges in it's curriculum. Unfortunately you can only complete so many challenges before it won't work properly anymore. It saves your progress and you can continue on your PC. Codecademy is a good one as well. There are many good video tutorials online, but I prefer to preserve my data for when It's needed. So I have found good podcasts to listen to on the drives. Codenewbie is one I am on now and they have guests from all walks of life whose stories give me daily inspiration to keep coding. hanselminutes.com and learntocode.me are good as well. There are also good books for free to learn from. Eloquent  Javascript is one I'm currently reading. Just keep coding!'  </p>
