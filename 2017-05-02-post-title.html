    <p>I started learning HTML and CSS originally around January. My brother, whose full-time job is web-development, got me started on this path. I have learned much and slacked much since then. My day job is small construction... I am tired of that. I have a passion for computers and enjoy coding, what I have learned thus far. I am committing myself, <em>May 5, 2017</em> to do at least 30 minutes of coding a day for 30 days, if not more. This is all per my brother's suggestion, but also a promise to myself. I will do that if not more, and log some of my experience along the way. Currently I am on Chapter 5 of <a href="https://internetingishard.com">Interneting is Hard</a> and I am simply learning about boxes and styling them. I must be off to bed for now, hopefully I can make something that is coherent and easy to follow for someone else who is new to coding. </br> Good Luck!</p>
