      <h1>This is my blog</h1>
    <p>This is my page to practice my markup and coding. I will log my experience along the way.</p>
    <h3>3/12/2017</h3>
    <p>So I just learned links. You can follow me on <a href="https://twitter.com/levicious">Twitter</a> or <a href="https://www.facebook.com/levinhayley.hornsby">Facebook</a>. But what I'm so excited about is that March 31st-April 2nd my wife and I will be attending <a href="http://fanexpodallas.com/">Fan Expo Dallas</a>! We're so excited! I'll be adding this to posts later as I continue to develop my site. I added these links just from what I've learned so I'm hoping it all works. I intend for this site to become a resum√® of sorts or simply to be a personal blog that some may take interest in. I am a Christian husband with three kids, I enjoy coding(It's my therapy), games, and collecting comics.</p>
